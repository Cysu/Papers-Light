# Introduction #

Papers-Lite is a cross-platform lightweight papers management software. There
are many other powerful softwares could provide better management. But they
either stick to a unique OS or need to be purchased. What I really want is just
adding some comments and tags to the papers, whenever I use a Linux PC
in the Lab or a MacBookAir at home. Therefore, a lightweight yet
cross-platform software is enough.

# Architecture #

Papers-Lite is based on Qt-5 for its cross-platform implementation and GUI
stuff. The data is stored in an SQLite database, which could be exported and 
synchronized as an SQLite-format file.
